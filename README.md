## ‚úÖ **What the Script Accurately Detects**

* **All cookies accessible via JavaScript** on the current page
* **Cookie names and values** (with truncation for long values for console clarity)
* **Attempted attribute detection**:

  * **Secure**: reliably inferred if Cookie Store API is available, or guessed based on page protocol (if not)
  * **HttpOnly**: can only be detected via Cookie Store API (not widely available); otherwise, cannot be detected in JS (see below)
  * **SameSite**: can only be detected via Cookie Store API (otherwise unknown)
* **Guesses purpose** based on common name patterns (session, auth, CSRF, analytics, localization, etc.)
* **Flags "important" cookies** (session/auth/CSRF tokens)
* **Flags session cookies** (by common naming and by absence of expiry date, if possible via Cookie Store API)

## ‚ùå **What the Script *Cannot* Detect (Browser/HTTP Security Model Limits)**

1. **HttpOnly cookies (if Cookie Store API is NOT available):**

   * **JavaScript never sees HttpOnly cookies.**
   * Only visible in browser **DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies**, and via **Set-Cookie headers** in the Network tab.
   * **Solution:** Always cross-check your Set-Cookie headers in the Network panel for *all* security attributes on sensitive cookies!

2. **Expiry/Persistence:**

   * JavaScript-accessible cookies don‚Äôt expose expiry unless using Cookie Store API (again, only available in modern Chrome/Edge).
   * Without this, you cannot reliably distinguish session vs persistent cookies just from `document.cookie`.

3. **Path, Domain Scope, and SameSite Strict/Lax/None (unless Cookie Store API is present):**

   * Not available from `document.cookie`.

4. **Cross-domain cookies or those set for parent/child subdomains (e.g., `.example.com`):**

   * You only see cookies available for the current document‚Äôs domain/path.

5. **Third-party cookies:**

   * The script only sees **first-party cookies**; third-party cookies set by iframes or included resources will not show up here.
   * Use the **DevTools Application ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Cookies** section to see those.

## üü¢ **Additional Security Considerations You Should Always Check**

* **Set-Cookie header review:**
  For each login/session/CSRF cookie, check that the backend sends them with `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax` or `Strict`.
  This is the only way to ensure that **even HttpOnly cookies** are set correctly.

* **Cookie Store API availability:**
  Chrome, Edge, and some other browsers support it. Firefox and Safari do **not** as of mid-2024.
  If you're working in a browser that supports this, your results will be more complete.

* **Flagging over-broad domain or path:**

  * You may want to flag cookies that are set on `.example.com` instead of `sub.example.com` (but this isn't visible from JS).
  * Again: review the Set-Cookie header.

* **Check for duplicated cookies:**

  * Sometimes the same cookie name is set with different Path/Domain‚Äîvisible in Set-Cookie headers or DevTools, **not** JS.

## üìù **If You Want Even More Accurate Analysis**

* **Augment with network analysis:**
  Use the **Network** tab ‚Üí right-click ‚Üí "Copy response headers" for any response setting cookies.
* **Automate with Selenium/Puppeteer:**
  For large applications, you could use browser automation to extract and aggregate Set-Cookie headers across flows/pages.
